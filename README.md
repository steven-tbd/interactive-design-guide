# **A Guide for Developing Interactive Systems**

---

## **Part 1: System Fundamentals**

### **1.1 Introduction**

This guide offers a structured framework and checklist for developing interactive installations. It builds on the classic Input → Process → Output (I/O) model by defining the specific components and interfaces that form a complete system.

An interactive system can be understood as a signal chain. Each link is a hardware or software component with a defined role, connected by clear interfaces and protocols.

A simple way to visualize this approach is with an I/O Signal Flow Diagram. This diagram provides a standardized visual language for mapping the complete path of data and control through a system.

### **1.2 Hardware Components**

Hardware components are the physical devices that handle input, processing, and output. This section organizes them by their primary role in the I/O signal chain.

#### **1.2.1 Inputs (Sensors)**

Sensors are components that measure a physical property and convert it into an electrical signal. This signal is typically either Analog (a continuous range) or Digital (a binary state), forming the "Input" stage of the signal chain.

#### **1.2.2 Processors (Primary & Secondary)**

## **Part 2: System Design & Architecture**

This part provides a decision-making framework for architecting a complete interactive system from the components detailed in Part 1. The objective of this framework is to produce a modular and reliable system architecture.

The following sections are structured to mirror a logical design workflow. The process begins with defining the high-level functional requirements and then moves to the core architectural decisions that form the system's technical foundation. Finally, it covers the advanced patterns and operational standards required for a successful and robust deployment.

### **2.1 Project Definition**

Before designing the technical architecture, the system’s functional requirements must be clear. This begins by defining the two “bookends” of the I/O chain: the desired output and the method of input.

##### **1. Define the Output (Functional Requirement):**
What is the system's primary function or observable effect? The answer to this question determines the necessary category of output components (e.g., actuators for motion, displays for visuals, DMX fixtures for light). This defines the ultimate goal of the signal chain.

##### **2. Define the Input (Interaction Requirement):**
How will the system be controlled by or interact with a user or its environment? The answer determines the necessary category of input components (e.g., a touch sensor for direct contact, a proximity sensor for presence, an environmental sensor for ambient conditions). This defines the origin of the signal chain.

Clearly defining the input and output requirements provides the initial constraints and goals for the subsequent technical design process.

### **2.2 System Architecture**

Once requirements are defined, the next step is designing the system architecture. This involves key decisions about processors and connectivity, along with patterns for scaling to complex installations.

#### **2.2.1 Core Decisions**

These are the foundational architectural choices for any single, self-contained interactive system. They define the primary processor and its connection to subsidiary hardware.

##### **Processor Selection**
Choose the simplest processor that can reliably do the job. Too much power adds cost and complexity; too little risks poor performance.

| Processor | Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Personal Computer (PC)** | For high-level show control, high-end graphics (real-time rendering, video playback), interfacing with complex sensors (e.g., Kinect, LiDAR), and for the flexibility of a visual programming environment. |
| **Single-Board Computer (SBC)** | As a dedicated "middle manager" for a complex task a microcontroller cannot handle, or when a full operating system (Linux) is required in an embedded form factor. The Klipper motion control system is a key example, where the SBC offloads computationally intensive motion planning from the PC and microcontroller. |
| **Microcontroller (MCU)** | For direct, real-time interaction with electronic components (sensors, motor drivers, LEDs), for tasks where precise, repeatable timing is critical, and to act as a simple "translator" that converts high-level commands into low-level hardware signals (I2C, PWM, STEP/DIR). |

##### **Connection Strategy (Tethered vs. Networked)**
This decision defines how processors connect to hardware, balancing reliability against flexibility.

| Connection | Principle | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tethered<br>(e.g., USB Serial)** | A direct physical connection is the most robust method, as it is immune to all network-related failure points (WiFi interference, IP conflicts, router issues). | Permanent or long-term installations where maximum reliability is required and the components are physically co-located. |
| **Networked<br>(e.g., Ethernet, WiFi)** | Networked communication (TCP/UDP) provides flexibility for development, wireless devices, and distributed systems. | Prototyping and development phases, systems with components that are inherently wireless, or installations distributed across a large physical space. This flexibility introduces potential network-related points of failure and depends on a well-managed network environment. |

#### **2.2.2 Advanced Patterns**

When a project's complexity moves beyond a single I/O chain, specific architectural patterns are required to manage the flow of data and control. The choice of pattern is determined by the relationship between the system's components.

##### **The Hub-and-Spoke Model**
This is a centralized control architecture for projects with multiple, independent interactive zones that are managed by a single master controller.

*   **Concept:** A central "Hub" PC manages the overall state of the experience. Each individual "Spoke" (an interactive station) runs its own logic but listens for high-level commands from the Hub.
*   **Use Case:** The standard for multi-exhibit museums, corporate briefing centers, and any environment where multiple distinct installations need to be synchronized or controlled from a single point.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Protocol:** MQTT is ideal for this architecture. The Hub "publishes" state commands (e.g., `/exhibit/state active`), and the Spokes "subscribe" to these topics. This decouples the systems; the Hub does not need to know the specific IP address of every Spoke.
    *   **Global vs. Local Inputs:** Each Spoke must be programmed to handle two distinct input types: **Global Commands** from the Hub (e.g., `active`, `idle`) and **Local Sensor Data** from its own hardware, which is typically only processed when in an `active` state.

| I/O Example: Hub-and-Spoke |
| :--- |
| `[Hub PC] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --> [Spoke A PC]` <br> `[Hub PC] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --> [Spoke B PC]` <br> `[Hub PC] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --> [Spoke C PC]` |

##### **The Pipeline Model**
This is a linear architecture where the output of one component serves as the direct input for the next, forming a processing chain.

*   **Concept:** Components are arranged in a sequence, like an assembly line for data. Each component performs a specific transformation on the data before passing it down the line.
*   **Use Case:** Extremely common for real-time media processing, generative art, and complex signal processing tasks.
*   **Example Workflow:** A camera feeds a computer vision system, which extracts tracking data. This data is sent to a graphics engine to generate visuals, which are then passed to a projection mapping server for output.

| I/O Example: Media Processing Pipeline |
| :--- |
| `[Depth Camera] --> {USB/Vendor SDK} --> [Vision PC (Processing)] --> {Ethernet/OSC} --> [Graphics PC (Rendering)] --> {Ethernet/NDI} --> [Mapping PC (Output)]` |

##### **The Decentralized (Peer-to-Peer) Model**
This is a distributed architecture with no central controller, where behavior emerges from the interaction of multiple peer nodes.

*   **Concept:** All nodes in the system are peers that can communicate directly with each other (or broadcast to all). The system’s behavior emerges from the simple rules and local interactions of its nodes.
*   **Use Case:** Ideal for creating emergent behavior, swarm robotics, and large-scale installations where many identical units (e.g., lights, small robots) need to react to each other and their immediate neighbors.
*   **Example Workflow:** A field of 100 LED nodes. Each node has a sensor and can broadcast its state to its neighbors. A rule like "if my neighbor turns red, I will slowly fade to red" can create complex, organic ripples of light that propagate across the entire field without any central controller dictating the pattern.

| I/O Example: Decentralized Network (Mesh) |
| :--- |
| `[Node A] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node B]` <br> `[Node B] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node C]` <br> `[Node C] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node A]` <br> `[Node A] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node C]` |
| *This example shows a mesh network where nodes can communicate directly with multiple peers, not just their immediate neighbors.* |

| I/O Example: Decentralized Network (Broadcast) |
| :--- |
| `[Node A] --> {WiFi/UDP Broadcast}` <br> `[Node B] --> {WiFi/UDP Broadcast}` <br> `[Node C] --> {WiFi/UDP Broadcast}` |
| *This example shows a broadcast model where any node can send a message that is received by all other nodes on the network simultaneously.* |

### **2.3 Deployment & Operational Reliability**

The long-term success of an interactive system depends on operational reliability. If a system is not robust, maintainable, and easy to deploy, it will fail in real-world use. This section outlines key principles for building reliable installations.

#### **2.3.1 Physical Plant**

The physical plant refers to the foundational infrastructure of the installation: power, safety, and networking.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Power** | *   Ensure sufficient power budget with comfortable headroom, accounting for peak or inrush current loads, not just average consumption.<br>*   Use professional-grade cabling, locking connectors, and strain relief to prevent accidental disconnection.<br>*   Clearly label all power supplies and circuits to simplify debugging and maintenance. |
| **Safety** | *   Define a clear "safe state" for all outputs (especially kinetic elements) in the event of a software crash or communication loss.<br>*   Implement a physical emergency stop that removes power to motion components while allowing control logic to remain powered for status reporting.<br>*   Document all potential physical hazards (e.g., pinch points, high temperatures) and verify all safety functions during commissioning. |
| **Networking** | *   Prefer wired Ethernet for all permanent installations; use dedicated, managed Wi-Fi only when mobility is a strict requirement.<br>*   Use stable IP addressing (DHCP reservations or static IPs) and ensure all devices are synchronized to a common time source (NTP).<br>*   Keep the show network simple and physically or logically isolated from public or guest internet access. |

#### **2.3.2 System Integrity**

System integrity refers to the health, state, and recoverability of the software and operating systems.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Observability** | *   Implement heartbeats or watchdogs between critical software components and hardware to detect failures automatically.<br>*   Maintain lightweight, timestamped logs for all applications to aid in post-failure diagnosis.<br>*   Expose a simple, easily accessible status indicator (e.g., a status web page, a physical LED) that provides a high-level overview of the system's health. |
| **Deployment &<br>Configuration** | *   Enable autostart on boot and automatic application recovery from crashes for all show-critical software.<br>*   Disable all OS-level sleep and power-saving modes on show machines.<br>*   Use version control (e.g., Git) for all code and critical configuration files to ensure reproducibility.<br>*   Pin all software dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected failures from package updates. |
| **Recovery** | *   Maintain complete system backups or "golden images" of all show computers.<br>*   Establish and test a clear rollback plan for reverting to a previously known-good state in the event of a failed update.<br>*   Physically test the system's recovery process from a full power loss. |

#### **2.3.3 Control Loops**

Control loops are a fundamental concept in system reliability, determining whether a system can verify the outcome of its own actions.

| Control Loop | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open-Loop System** | An open-loop system sends a command to an output but does not receive confirmation that the action was successfully executed. It operates on assumption. | A show controller tells a media server to "play video file C." It assumes the command worked. If the server is offline or the file missing, the controller continues the show with a blank screen—without knowing something failed. |
| **Closed-Loop System** | A closed-loop system uses a return message (feedback) to verify the state of an output, allowing it to make decisions and take corrective action. | A show controller sends a "play video file C" command. The media server replies with a confirmation such as `"/video/C/playback_started."` The controller now knows playback began. If no reply arrives within a timeout, it can log an error, alert an operator, or attempt recovery. |

Designing with closed-loop feedback is a hallmark of professional and robust interactive systems.

### **2.4 Conclusion: The Modular Approach**

The most successful interactive systems follow a modular philosophy. The principles in this section—from defining I/O requirements to choosing architecture and ensuring reliability—break complex systems into specialized, independent, testable components.

The I/O Signal Flow Diagram is the blueprint for this modular design. By mastering the process of selecting the right components for the right jobs and connecting them with the right interfaces, the gap between the initial project definition and a robust, functional system disappears.

## **Part 4: Appendix**

This appendix contains supplemental technical details and concepts that are relevant to the main guide.

### **4.1 Supplemental Concepts**

#### **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
IPC refers to the methods an operating system provides for multiple, independent software applications on a single computer to exchange data. This enables a modular software architecture where each program has a single, well-defined job (e.g., one for creative logic, one for hardware communication).

*   **Common Methods:**
    *   **localhost Sockets (UDP/TCP):** Using network protocols to send data internally via the OS loopback interface.
    *   **Virtual Serial Port:** A pair of linked virtual COM ports that allow two applications to communicate as if connected by a physical serial cable.
    *   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A formal set of rules, like the Moonraker API for Klipper, that allows one program to send structured commands to another.

#### **Timecode Generation**
SMPTE Timecode is generated by a component acting as the master clock for an entire synchronized system. This role can be filled by either dedicated hardware or specialized software, with the choice depending on the scale and reliability requirements of the project.

*   **Dedicated Hardware Generators**
    *   **Description:** These are specialized devices whose sole purpose is to generate a stable and accurate timecode signal. They use high-precision internal crystal oscillators to ensure minimal timing drift.
    *   **Use Case:** They are the standard for large-scale professional installations due to their high reliability, acting as the definitive master clock to which all other systems slave.
    *   **Hardware Examples:** Rosendahl Nanosyncs HD, Evertz Master Clock Generators, Brainstorm Electronics SR-112.
*   **Software-Based Generators**
    *   **Description:** Many professional AV applications can be configured to act as a timecode master. The software uses the computer's internal clock to generate a timecode signal and sends it out over a network, audio, or MIDI interface.
    *   **Use Case:** This approach is convenient for smaller systems or those running on a single PC, as it requires no additional hardware. One application (e.g., a media server or audio workstation) is designated as the master, and all other software slaves to it.
    *   **Software Examples:** Media Servers (TouchDesigner, Disguise), Digital Audio Workstations (Reaper, Ableton Live), and Lighting Consoles (grandMA).

### **4.2 Supplemental Component Details**

#### **FPGA Technical Notes**
An FPGA is not a processor that executes a software instruction set. It is a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and interconnects. A developer uses a Hardware Description Language (HDL) to describe a digital circuit; a toolchain then synthesizes this description into a bitfile that configures the FPGA's CLBs and routing to *become* that circuit. This parallel, hardware-level execution is why FPGAs excel at tasks like high-bandwidth video processing, where a specific, repetitive task must be performed on a massive stream of data at extremely low latency.

#### **I/O Expansion Boards**
These are a form of secondary processor that provides a large number of general-purpose inputs and outputs (GPIO) controllable from a single host connection (e.g., USB, Ethernet). They offload the task of managing a massive number of individual pins, allowing a PC to read the state of 32 buttons or control 32 relays with a single command. Examples include Phidgets interface boards and industrial Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

#### **Sensors with Onboard Processing**
Many advanced sensors are themselves complex systems containing powerful secondary processors. A LiDAR scanner or depth camera, for example, uses an internal processor to perform immense calculations (e.g., converting raw sensor readings into a 3D point cloud) before sending structured data to the primary computer.

### **4.3 Recommended Tools**

*   **Wireshark:** An essential, open-source network protocol analyzer.
    *   **Use:** Debugging network messages by capturing and inspecting raw packet data for protocols like UDP, OSC, Art-Net, etc.
