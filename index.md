## **Part 1: System Fundamentals**

### **1.1 Introduction**

This guide outlines a structured framework for designing interactive systems. It expands the Input → Process → Output (I/O) model into a signal chain of hardware and software components, each connected by defined interfaces and protocols. The I/O Signal Flow Diagram offers a standardized method for mapping this chain, making the flow of data and control across the system clear and consistent.

## **Part 2: System Design & Architecture**

Part 2 moves from components to system-level design. It provides a framework for defining project requirements, selecting processors, choosing communication strategies, and applying architectural patterns. The goal is to create modular, reliable systems that can scale in complexity.

### **2.1 Project Definition**

Before designing the technical architecture, the system’s functional requirements must be clear. This begins by defining the two “bookends” of the I/O chain: the desired output and the method of input.

#### **2.1.1 Define the Output (Functional Requirement)**
What is the system's primary function or observable effect? The answer to this question determines the necessary category of output components (e.g., actuators for motion, displays for visuals, DMX fixtures for light). This defines the ultimate goal of the signal chain.

#### **2.1.2. Define the Input (Interaction Requirement)**
How will the system be controlled by or interact with a user or its environment? The answer determines the necessary category of input components (e.g., a touch sensor for direct contact, a proximity sensor for presence, an environmental sensor for ambient conditions). This defines the origin of the signal chain.

### **2.2 System Architecture**

Once requirements are defined, the next step is designing the system architecture. This involves key decisions about processors and connectivity, along with patterns for scaling to complex installations.

#### **2.2.1 Core Decisions**

These decisions establish the system’s foundation: which processor will be used, and how it will connect to other components. These choices define the balance between complexity, reliability, and scalability.

**Processor Selection**
Processor selection should balance reliability with simplicity. The chosen processor must meet requirements without introducing unnecessary complexity or limiting performance.

| Processor | Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Personal Computer (PC)** | For high-level show control, high-end graphics (real-time rendering, video playback), interfacing with complex sensors (e.g., Kinect, LiDAR), and for the flexibility of a visual programming environment. |
| **Single-Board Computer (SBC)** | As a dedicated "middle manager" for a complex task a microcontroller cannot handle, or when a full operating system (Linux) is required in an embedded form factor. The Klipper motion control system is a key example, where the SBC offloads computationally intensive motion planning from the PC and microcontroller. |
| **Microcontroller (MCU)** | For direct, real-time interaction with electronic components (sensors, motor drivers, LEDs), for tasks where precise, repeatable timing is critical, and to act as a simple "translator" that converts high-level commands into low-level hardware signals (I2C, PWM, STEP/DIR). |

**Connection Strategy (Tethered vs. Networked)**
This decision defines how processors connect to hardware, balancing reliability against flexibility.

| Connection | Principle | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tethered**<br>(e.g., USB Serial) | A direct physical connection is the most robust method, as it is immune to all network-related failure points (WiFi interference, IP conflicts, router issues). | Permanent or long-term installations where maximum reliability is required and the components are physically co-located. |
| **Networked**<br>(e.g., Ethernet, WiFi) | Networked communication (TCP/UDP) provides flexibility for development, wireless devices, and distributed systems. | Prototyping and development phases, systems with components that are inherently wireless, or installations distributed across a large physical space. This flexibility introduces potential network-related points of failure and depends on a well-managed network environment. |

#### **2.2.2 Advanced Patterns**

Advanced patterns address the needs of larger or more complex systems. By structuring components into hubs, pipelines, or decentralized networks, designers can handle scaling, synchronization, and emergent behaviors.

**The Hub-and-Spoke Model**
This is a centralized control architecture for projects with multiple, independent interactive zones that are managed by a single master controller.
*   **Concept:** A central "Hub" PC manages the overall state of the experience. Each individual "Spoke" (an interactive station) runs its own logic but listens for high-level commands from the Hub.
*   **Use Case:** The standard for multi-exhibit museums, corporate briefing centers, and any environment where multiple distinct installations need to be synchronized or controlled from a single point.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Protocol:** MQTT is ideal for this architecture. The Hub "publishes" state commands (e.g., `/exhibit/state active`), and the Spokes "subscribe" to these topics. This decouples the systems; the Hub does not need to know the specific IP address of every Spoke.
    *   **Global vs. Local Inputs:** Each Spoke must be programmed to handle two distinct input types: **Global Commands** from the Hub (e.g., active, idle) and **Local Sensor Data** from its own hardware, which is typically only processed when in an active state.

**I/O Example: Hub-and-Spoke**
```
[Hub PC (Processor/Global Controller)] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --⬎
    [Exhibit PC (Processor/TouchDesigner)] --> {Cable/HDMI} --> [Video Wall (Output/Display)]
[Touch Sensor (Input/Sensor)] --> {USB/HID} --⬏

[Hub PC] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --> [Spoke A PC]
[Hub PC] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --> [Spoke B PC]
[Hub PC] --> {Ethernet/MQTT} --> [Spoke C PC]
```

**The Pipeline Model**
This is a linear architecture where the output of one component serves as the direct input for the next, forming a processing chain.
*   **Concept:** Components are arranged in a sequence, like an assembly line for data. Each component performs a specific transformation on the data before passing it down the line.
*   **Use Case:** Extremely common for real-time media processing, generative art, and complex signal processing tasks.
*   **Example Workflow:** A camera feeds a computer vision system, which extracts tracking data. This data is sent to a graphics engine to generate visuals, which are then passed to a projection mapping server for output.

**I/O Example: Media Processing Pipeline**
```
[Depth Camera] --> {USB/Vendor SDK} --> [Vision PC (Processing)] --> {Ethernet/OSC} --> [Graphics PC (Rendering)] --> {Ethernet/NDI} --> [Mapping PC (Output)]
```

**The Decentralized (Peer-to-Peer) Model**
This is a distributed architecture with no central controller, where behavior emerges from the interaction of multiple peer nodes.
*   **Concept:** All nodes in the system are peers that can communicate directly with each other (or broadcast to all). The system’s behavior emerges from the simple rules and local interactions of its nodes.
*   **Use Case:** Ideal for creating emergent behavior, swarm robotics, and large-scale installations where many identical units (e.g., lights, small robots) need to react to each other and their immediate neighbors.
*   **Example Workflow:** A field of 100 LED nodes. Each node has a sensor and can broadcast its state to its neighbors. A rule like "if my neighbor turns red, I will slowly fade to red" can create complex, organic ripples of light that propagate across the entire field without any central controller dictating the pattern.

**I/O Example: Decentralized Network (Mesh)**
A mesh network where nodes can communicate directly with multiple peers, not just their immediate neighbors.
```
[Node A] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node B]
[Node B] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node C]
[Node C] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node A]
[Node A] <--> {WiFi/UDP} <--> [Node C]
```

**I/O Example: Decentralized Network (Broadcast)**
A broadcast model where any node can send a message that is received by all other nodes on the network simultaneously.
```
[Node A] --> {WiFi/UDP Broadcast}
[Node B] --> {WiFi/UDP Broadcast}
[Node C] --> {WiFi/UDP Broadcast}
```

### **2.3 Deployment & Operational Reliability**

Designing a system is only the first step—operating it reliably over time is the greater challenge. This section addresses power, networking, software integrity, and feedback loops to ensure installations remain stable and maintainable in real-world conditions.

#### **2.3.1 Physical Plant**

The physical plant covers the infrastructure required to run an installation safely and reliably. This includes power distribution, cabling, and networking standards.

| Category | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Power** | • Ensure sufficient power budget with comfortable headroom, accounting for peak or inrush current loads, not just average consumption.<br>• Use professional-grade cabling, locking connectors, and strain relief to prevent accidental disconnection.<br>• Clearly label all power supplies and circuits to simplify debugging and maintenance. |
| **Safety** | • Define a clear "safe state" for all outputs (especially kinetic elements) in the event of a software crash or communication loss.<br>• Implement a physical emergency stop that removes power to motion components while allowing control logic to remain powered for status reporting.<br>• Document all potential physical hazards (e.g., pinch points, high temperatures) and verify all safety functions during commissioning. |
| **Networking** | • Prefer wired Ethernet for all permanent installations; use dedicated, managed Wi-Fi only when mobility is a strict requirement.<br>• Use stable IP addressing (DHCP reservations or static IPs) and ensure all devices are synchronized to a common time source (NTP).<br>• Keep the show network simple and physically or logically isolated from public or guest internet access. |

#### **2.3.2 System Integrity**

System integrity focuses on keeping software and operating environments stable. It includes monitoring, deployment practices, and recovery strategies.

| Category | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Observability** | • Implement heartbeats or watchdogs between critical software components and hardware to detect failures automatically.<br>• Maintain lightweight, timestamped logs for all applications to aid in post-failure diagnosis.<br>• Expose a simple, easily accessible status indicator (e.g., a status web page, a physical LED) that provides a high-level overview of the system's health. |
| **Deployment &<br>Configuration** | • Enable autostart on boot and automatic application recovery from crashes for all show-critical software.<br>• Disable all OS-level sleep and power-saving modes on show machines.<br>• Use version control (e.g., Git) for all code and critical configuration files to ensure reproducibility.<br>• Pin all software dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected failures from package updates. |
| **Recovery** | • Maintain complete system backups or "golden images" of all show computers.<br>• Establish and test a clear rollback plan for reverting to a previously known-good state in the event of a failed update.<br>• Physically test the system's recovery process from a full power loss. |

#### **2.3.3 Control Loops**

Control loops determine whether a system can verify and adjust its own actions. Open-loop systems assume success, while closed-loop systems use feedback to ensure reliability.

| Control Loop | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open-Loop System** | An open-loop system sends a command to an output but does not receive confirmation that the action was successfully executed. It operates on assumption. | A show controller tells a media server to "play video file C." It assumes the command worked. If the server is offline or the file missing, the controller continues the show with a blank screen—without knowing something failed. |
| **Closed-Loop System** | A closed-loop system uses a return message (feedback) to verify the state of an output, allowing it to make decisions and take corrective action. | A show controller sends a "play video file C" command. The media server replies with a confirmation such as "/video/C/playback_started." The controller now knows playback began. If no reply arrives within a timeout, it can log an error, alert an operator, or attempt recovery. |

*Designing with closed-loop feedback is a hallmark of professional and robust interactive systems.*

### **2.4 Conclusion: The Modular Approach**

The most successful interactive systems follow a modular philosophy. The principles in this section—from defining I/O requirements to choosing architecture and ensuring reliability—break complex systems into specialized, independent, and testable components.

By combining the component-level foundation of Part 1 with the architectural strategies of Part 2, designers can build interactive systems that are both precise and scalable—bridging the gap between concept and robust deployment.

## **Part 4: Appendix**

The appendix contains supplemental technical details and deeper dives into specialized topics. These sections provide additional context for advanced users and expand on concepts referenced earlier in the guide.

### **4.1 Supplemental Concepts**

#### **4.1.1 Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
IPC methods allow separate programs running on the same system to exchange data, enabling modular software design where each program has a single, well-defined job (e.g., one for creative logic, one for hardware communication).
*   **Common Methods:**
    *   **localhost Sockets (UDP/TCP):** Using network protocols to send data internally via the OS loopback interface.
    *   **Virtual Serial Port:** A pair of linked virtual COM ports that allow two applications to communicate as if connected by a physical serial cable.
    *   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A formal set of rules, like the Moonraker API for Klipper, that allows one program to send structured commands to another.

#### **4.1.2 Timecode Generation**
Timecode provides a shared clock for synchronizing video, audio, and lighting systems at frame-level accuracy.This role can be filled by either dedicated hardware or specialized software, with the choice depending on the scale and reliability requirements of the project.
*   **Dedicated Hardware Generators**
    *   **Description:** These are specialized devices whose sole purpose is to generate a stable and accurate timecode signal. They use high-precision internal crystal oscillators to ensure minimal timing drift.
    *   **Use Case:** They are the standard for large-scale professional installations due to their high reliability, acting as the definitive master clock to which all other systems slave.
    *   **Hardware Examples:** Rosendahl Nanosyncs HD, Evertz Master Clock Generators, Brainstorm Electronics SR-112.
*   **Software-Based Generators**
    *   **Description:** Many professional AV applications can be configured to act as a timecode master. The software uses the computer's internal clock to generate a timecode signal and sends it out over a network, audio, or MIDI interface.
    *   **Use Case:** This approach is convenient for smaller systems or those running on a single PC, as it requires no additional hardware. One application (e.g., a media server or audio workstation) is designated as the master, and all other software slaves to it.
    *   **Software Examples:** Media Servers (TouchDesigner, Disguise), Digital Audio Workstations (Reaper, Ableton Live), and Lighting Consoles (grandMA).

### **4.2 Supplemental Component Details**

#### **4.2.1 FPGA Technical Notes**
An FPGA is not a processor that executes a software instruction set. It is a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and interconnects. A developer uses a Hardware Description Language (HDL) to describe a digital circuit; a toolchain then synthesizes this description into a bitfile that configures the FPGA's CLBs and routing to *become* that circuit. This parallel, hardware-level execution is why FPGAs excel at tasks like high-bandwidth video processing, where a specific, repetitive task must be performed on a massive stream of data at extremely low latency.

#### **4.2.2 I/O Expansion Boards**
These are a form of secondary processor that provides a large number of general-purpose inputs and outputs (GPIO) controllable from a single host connection (e.g., USB, Ethernet). They offload the task of managing a massive number of individual pins, allowing a PC to read the state of 32 buttons or control 32 relays with a single command. Examples include Phidgets interface boards and industrial Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

#### **4.2.3 Sensors with Onboard Processing**
Many advanced sensors are themselves complex systems containing powerful secondary processors. A LiDAR scanner or depth camera, for example, uses an internal processor to perform immense calculations (e.g., converting raw sensor readings into a 3D point cloud) before sending structured data to the primary computer.

### **4.3 Recommended Tools**

| Category | Tool | Description | Primary Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network Analysis** | **Wireshark** | An essential, open-source network protocol analyzer. | Deep-level debugging of network messages by capturing and inspecting raw packet data for protocols like UDP, OSC, Art-Net, etc. |
| | **OSC/UDP Monitor**<br>(e.g., Protokol) | A simple, real-time message viewer. | Quickly checking if OSC or UDP messages are being sent and received correctly without the complexity of Wireshark. |
| **Hardware &<br>Electronics** | **Digital Multimeter** | A fundamental diagnostic tool for electronics. | Measuring voltage, checking for continuity in cables and solder joints, and testing component current draw. |
| | **Logic Analyzer**<br>(e.g., Saleae Logic) | A device that captures and displays signals from a digital system. | Debugging hardware-level interfaces like I2C, SPI, and UART by visualizing the raw digital signals on the wires. |
| | **Circuit Diagramming Software**<br>(e.g., Fritzing) | Open-source software for creating electronics diagrams, especially for breadboard-based prototypes. | Documenting and teaching circuit layouts, creating clear wiring diagrams for prototypes, and moving from a breadboard view to a schematic or simple PCB design. |
| **Software & System<br>Management** | **Version Control (Git)** | A distributed system for tracking changes in source code and configuration files. | Maintaining a project history, collaborating with others, and creating a reliable rollback plan. |
| | **Terminal Multiplexer**<br>(e.g., tmux, GNU Screen) | A tool for managing multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single window. | Managing processes on headless systems (like a Raspberry Pi) and maintaining sessions after disconnecting. |
